An online drawing tool with scalable pixel-like grids.

This project was built as part of The Odin Project to practice and showcase my ability to utilize DOM manipulation and event listeners.

This project gave me a deeper understanding on DOM manipulation, how bubbling works, and how each aspect of the page (html, css, JS) interacts with each other.
